&lt;p&gt;Sometime last year I was dead set on starting to blog but then life hit me hard in a positive way. My baby girl was born, got a new project in a different city so I had to move across the country&amp;#8230;that was an adventure on it&amp;#8217;s own. So between setting my life up again, getting to know people and learning all sorts of new things for my role I completely forgot about the blog not to mention that now that I&amp;#8217;m a dad I love spending my free time with my baby&amp;nbsp;girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still the blog was still in the back of my mind so for this 2019 instead of making it part of my &amp;#8216;New Year Resolution&amp;#8217; which to be honest I never fullfil, decided to just &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOLO&lt;/span&gt; do it. But this time it was going to be more &amp;#8220;me&amp;#8221; if it makes sense and since I now know more on how Python/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; work I came up with a new theme and everything customized to what I wanted (some things are still pending like mobile navigation but I&amp;#8217;ll get to it,&amp;nbsp;promise!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of blog posts I will share with everyone and some of them include some of the new tools that I&amp;#8217;m using at work so it should be&amp;nbsp;fun.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry></feed>
