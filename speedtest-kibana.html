  <article class="content"><p>With the working from home situation my wife has been complaining that the internet is somewhat slower which makes sense since we now have more devices on and streaming content&#8230; I have watched Frozen 1 and 2 over 30 times now&#8230;.. but figured I should double check to see the actual numbers, so I consulted the good ol&#8217; site <a href="http://speedtest.net">speedtest.net</a> and ran couple tests and noticed that I am indeed getting sometimes half of what I&#8217;m paying for and some other times I do get more than I should. As <span class="caps">FYI</span> I&#8217;m paying $45 for 100 mbps which is pretty nice in my&nbsp;opinion.</p>
<p>Either way, I had no intention to keep visiting the site every so often and when my wife said it was slow I didn&#8217;t want to check if my <span class="caps">ISP</span> was working properly so I discovered there&#8217;s a <span class="caps">CLI</span> that executes that test we all know and love in the site and displays the results in machine readable formats. So here&#8217;s when the engineer (lazy) part of my brain kicked in and gave me an obvious solution&#8230;. automate the whole thing. So overall here&#8217;s what I said I would&nbsp;do.</p>
<ul>
<li>First step, get the <span class="caps">CLI</span> and run it couple times to know what the parameters you are looking for do, in my case i wanted something that would execute the test against a not so local server since it&#8217;s not realistic that most of my internet requests end up couple miles from where i&nbsp;live.</li>
<li>Second step, dump the data into a file that can be easily parsed and ingested into a system, in this case my preference is Elasticsearch since I can keep the data and I&#8217;m quite familiar with it so building the mapping and visualizations is super simple. The ingestion can be done by either writing a script to push it out or you can do it the lazy way and setup a filebeat agent that will simply collect the data from the results file in json format and will push that directly into my existing Elasticsearch&nbsp;cluster.</li>
<li>Third step, generate some graphs to visualize how my <span class="caps">ISP</span> is treating&nbsp;me.</li>
</ul>
<p>I won&#8217;t go much into detail as this is supposed to be a quick post, but do let me know if you get stuck somewhere, social media details at the&nbsp;bottom.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the <span class="caps">CLI</span> from the official site - <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli">https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli</a></li>
<li>
<p>Either create a cron task to run the script every X minutes or use a systemd timer unit (this depends on your preference completely). Here&#8217;s my systemd timer and service files in case you want to copy it. Got place it in <code>/etc/systemd/system/</code> and start <span class="amp">&amp;</span> enable it using <code>sudo systemctl enable speedtest.timer</code> this should take care of calling the service every 10 minutes which is plenty for my case.

</li>
<li>
<p>With that in place the script should place the output of the file under your home folder so make sure it&nbsp;exists.</p>
</li>
<li>Next, you need to have filebeat running and configured to keep tabs in that <code>speedtest.log</code> file. Here&#8217;s again a snippet of my configuration for both <code>filebeat.yml</code> and the service file that runs it.<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">[Unit]</span>

</code></pre></div>


</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the file is already formatted as <span class="caps">JSON</span> we will tell filebeat we want to decode it as is and place the keys under root so we can search them, also I&#8217;m adding a field for those events so I can filter as needed. It&#8217;s always a good idea and practice to &#8220;tag&#8221; your&nbsp;data.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">filebeat.inputs</span><span class="p">:</span>

</code></pre></div>


<ol>
<li>With the data inside the cluster, all you got to do next is just build up some visualizations. Here&#8217;s some of the ones I built using those details. Now I got a holistic view of how my <span class="caps">ISP</span> is treating me, can get historic data on how it behaved, the number of packets and ping I&#8217;m getting, it&#8217;s quite&nbsp;nice.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Kibana-Dashboard" src="https://mvaldes14.github.io/blog/images/posts/speedtest-kibana.png"></p>
<p>As you can tell data is beautiful and with Kibana it&#8217;s quite easy to visualize, this was a quick on how to ingest something from a script and use it to your advantage. I would like to also collect all of the packets coming in and out for all of my devices so I could measure my usage as well but that requires custom devices used as gateways and more complex&nbsp;setups.</p>
<p>See you in the next&nbsp;one.</p></article>
